# Structure

1) to calculate the partial dependence plots for 10000 randomly mixed but independent datasets, use the .py scripts

2) To get the relative importances of the variables in the models and the skill metrics of the models, use the .ipynb notebooks

the wording "calves" or "environment" refers to the two different data sets, one for the samples taking from the feces ("calves") and one for the samples taking from the environment around the calves ("environment")
